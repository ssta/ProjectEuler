   * We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all
   * the digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is
   * 1 through 5 pandigital.
   * <p>
   * The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing
   * multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.
   * <p>
   * Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product
   * identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.
   * <p>
   * HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only
   * include it once in your sum.
