  /* After some research, and some algebra, the solutions to this for any n
    is the solution to the diophanitne equation:
      2(b^2) - 2b -n^2 +n = 0.

    After significantly more research andf without me really understanding
    why (mathematica website isn't the best ever at explaining stuff), turns
    out that this can be solved for any n with the following recurrence
    relations:
      b_{k+1} = 3b_{k} + 2n_{k} - 2
      n_{k+1} = 4b_{k} + 3n_{k} - 3

    Where b is the number of blue disks in the next solution and n is the
    total number of disks.

    This is trivial (and FAST) to implement:
